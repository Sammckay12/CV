## Sam McKay

I am a former Business Analyst who one day woke up to the realisation that offering possible solutions to multiple problems would never be as satisfying as implementing the solution in the problem-solving process. Less talking and more doing, as they say.

My ideal position would be working as a Back End Junior Developer where every day poses new challenges that put my analytical and problem-solving skills to the test. An energetic and teamwork focused environment that enables growth both on a technical level and within the personal development sphere.

DAY 1 VALUE


## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Honing in on the specific underlying business problem is a skill that perhaps I may not have even valued highly enough at the time of acquiring it. My previous line manager would always enforce the idea of separating problems from solutions as the business would reel off their requirements. Now approaching problems from the software engineering perspective the efficiency gains and even being able to identify the task at hand are benefits that are now all too apparent.


#### Communication

Being able to translate complex problems into a concise and easy to follow statement is key to being able to reach a solution to the problem you are facing.

Outside of the workspace I see myself as a very approachable and personable person who enjoys meeting new people and the social side of life. This adds value in the working environment as people are more comfortable around you and aids collaboration and a good team ethos.



#### Enthusiastic

Never phased by the potential size of a problem, enthusiasm plays an imperative role in dispersing any feelings that you may be out of your depth or daunted by the size of a task.

As a large part of time for a junior developer is spent solving bugs and following the flow through error messages, there is nothing like a healthy dose of enthusiasm to not let your head drop and keep going with high spirits when the bug is being particularly sneaky!
